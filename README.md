## Problem Statement
Access to timely, understandable, and actionable environmental health data is a critical global challenge. Public health officials, NGOs, and communities often struggle to connect complex environmental factors‚Äîlike climate, geography, and pollution‚Äîto specific, localized health risks. This information gap leads to reactive healthcare systems that treat diseases after they emerge, rather than preventing them. There is a pressing need for a tool that can democratize environmental intelligence, making it easy for anyone to understand the potential health hazards in their immediate surroundings and take proactive measures.

## Overview of Our Solution
GeoSick is a cutting-edge web application that bridges the gap between environmental data and public health. Powered by Google's advanced Gemini AI models, GeoSick provides users with an intuitive platform to analyze environmental health risks from anywhere in the world.

By leveraging AI for location-based analysis, image recognition, and natural language processing, GeoSick transforms raw data into a clear, actionable intelligence briefing. It identifies potential hazards, predicts associated diseases, suggests preventive measures, and connects users with nearby health resources. Our goal is to empower individuals and communities to shift from a reactive to a proactive stance on health, mitigating crises before they begin.
